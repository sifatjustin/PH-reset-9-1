            <h2>"In the near future, I hope to <br> become a Developer."</h2>
            <p>In the near future, I aspire to become a developer, a role that will allow me to channel my skills and
                creativity into building innovative software solutions. With my current knowledge of HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript, I am well on my way to mastering the fundamentals of web development. As I continue to learn
                and grow, I will unlock new opportunities to design, code, and implement applications that can make a
                real impact in the tech world.</p>
